            <h2> The Birth of Dzovah</h2>
            <div class="author">By Githinji</div>
            <div class="author" style="margin-bottom:1.5rem;">A self-reflection on vision, clarity, and the journey of building Dzovah.</div>
            <p>For years I've been having a blurry picture of what I want to create. Nilijiambia kila kitu itakua clear tu.<br>
            It finally has. Kila kitu Iko crystal clear.</p>
            <h3 style="color:#ffb6b6;">Dzovah</h3>
            <p><b>Slogan:</b> <em>"Make It Happen"</em></p>
            <h3>What?</h3>
            <p>Dzovah is going to be a company built by engineers, for engineers.<br>
            The mission will be simple: <b>"helping engineers make it happen."</b></p>
            <p>Whether people are aspiring engineers, seasoned pros, or anywhere in between, Dzovah will exist to inspire and equip them with the knowledge, tools, and resources to build whatever they want—no limits, no barriers.</p>
            <h3>How?</h3>
            <p>Whether people are designing, coding, building, or innovating. It will offer a space where ideas come to life through cutting-edge tech, curated resources, and a community that thrives on pushing boundaries. The platform will provide hands-on learning, real-world tools, and access to the latest technologies so people can focus on doing what engineers do best—building cool things.</p>
            <h3>Also....</h3>
            <p>We won't stop at empowering engineers; we will also create. Dzovah will sell out-of-this-world technology, inspired by the very ideas that engineers bring to life on the platform. From futuristic robots to cutting-edge gadgets, the tech we will develop is not just advanced—it’s visionary. This isn’t your average technology—it’s the future.</p>
            <h3>How did Dzovah come about?</h3>
            <p>Dzovah was born from a simple passion: building things.<br>
            As an engineer, I’ve always loved creating, designing, and problem-solving, but I realized something critical—the journey isn’t easy.</p>
            <p>Engineering requires constant learning, access to the right resources, and a community to lean on, yet those essentials are often hard to come by.</p>
            <p>The frustration of not having what I needed pushed me to think: what if there was something that could change that?</p>
            <p>So, I envisioned Dzovah—a platform to empower engineers with the tools and inspiration to turn their ideas into reality.<br>
            It's not just a company; it's a catalyst for action.</p>
            <p>We don’t just talk about building things—we do it. Creating innovative solutions, developing state-of-the-art technology, and providing the expertise engineers need to make things happen.</p>
            <p><b>If you have an idea, Dzovah gives you the tools and inspiration to bring it to life.</b></p>
